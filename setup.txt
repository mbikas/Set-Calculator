Name of the Application: SetCalculator 
Language: C++
Development IDE: Xcode5.1.1
Development Environment: MacOSX

How to Run the SetCalculator
----------------------------
Using g++ compiler in Windows from the terminal:
1. Install and configure cygwin (if required):
	a. Download and install cygwin from: https://www.cygwin.com/
	b. Configure the bin path (C:/cygwin64/bin) as system environment variable
	c. Test with giving command from terminal: g++ -v 
2. Open a terminal and go to the directory of the cpp file (/SetManager)
3. Give the following command to compile:
	g++ -o SetCalculator *.cpp
4. Give the following command to run the application:
	SetCalculator    or  ./SetCalculator( for unix) 
5. It will show list of available command in the console window

Using Xcode:
1. Install Xcode (if required)
2. Double click or open the project file SetCalculator.xcodeproj from the directory SetCalculator/Calculator.xcodeproj
3. Product -> Run to run the main file
4. It will show list of available command in the console window

Available Commands to Operate the SetCalculator 
————————————————————————
Press l : To initialize Set A and B as LinkedList
Press 0 : To initialize Set A and B as OrderedCollection
Press e : To Erase all the elements from Set A
Press s : To Switch between Set A and B
Press c : For copying elements from Set A to Set B
Press d : For Displaying Set A and B
Press a : For Adding element to A
Press u : For Union. A = A union B 
Press i : For Intersection. A = A intersection B
Press q : Quit Set Manager


Implementation Details
———————————
1. The SetCalculator implementation contains following classes:
a. Set: Abstract base class for Set for two of its subclass SetAsList and SetAsOC
b. SetAsList: Concrete Derived Class of Set. This class implements all the operations of  Set using LinkedList. 
	b.1. This class uses another helper class Node. 
d. SetAsOC: Concrete Derived Class of Set. This class implements all the operations of Set using Ordered Collection.
e. SetManager: for managing the two sets A and B
f. main: Main class of the project. To give commands from console to operate the two set.

2. Some of important features implemented:
a. copy constructor
b. virtual destructor
c. virtual copy function
d. assignment operator overloading 
e. index operator([]) overloading
f. Common features of the set like: add, remove, removeAll, swap, size, print, union, intersection
